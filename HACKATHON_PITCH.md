# Genesis Heritage Pro: Hackathon Pitch & Demo Script

---

## 1. The Hook (30 seconds)

**Presenter:** "In today's global market, businesses are losing their most valuable asset: their identity. They struggle to connect their rich cultural heritage with modern, fast-paced operations. At the same time, individuals feel disconnected from their roots in a digital world. What if you could turn your heritage into your greatest competitive advantage? What if you could automate your business while amplifying your culture?"

## 2. The Problem (30 seconds)

**Presenter:** "Businesses face a dilemma: embrace generic, efficient automation and risk losing their unique cultural identity, or cling to tradition and fall behind. Individuals find their family stories, recipes, and traditions scattered and fading. This leads to generic brands, disengaged customers, and a lost sense of self."

## 3. The Solution: Genesis Heritage Pro (1 minute)

**Presenter:** "Introducing Genesis Heritage Pro. We don't just automate your business; we integrate your soul. Our platform is the first to fuse deep cultural intelligence with enterprise-grade automation."

*(Transition to a live demo of the main dashboard, showing a vibrant, integrated view.)*

**Demo Flow:**

*   **A. The Onboarding:** "Let's start with a new user, Alex, who runs a family restaurant. Alex onboards by providing cultural background—Chinese-Malaysian—and business goals."
*   **B. The Cultural Hub:** "Instantly, the platform populates with relevant cultural data. Here in the **Timeline**, we see Alex's grandfather opening the first restaurant. In the **Cultural Artifacts**, we have Grandma's secret 'Char Siu' recipe."
    *(Click through the pre-populated data from `seed.sql`)*.
*   **C. The Fusion Insight:** "Now, the magic. Our AI analyzes these cultural data points. See here? It suggests a 'digital red envelope' marketing campaign for Lunar New Year, combining a tradition with a modern business action. This isn't a generic campaign; it's a culturally resonant one."
*   **D. The Automation:** "Let's activate that. In our **Automation Hub**, we can trigger this workflow with a single click, or even a voice command... *(Lean in)* 'Genesis, run the New Year customer engagement workflow.'"
    *(Show the voice command toast notification and the workflow being "triggered".)*

## 4. Technical Excellence & "Why Bolt.new?" (1 minute)

**Presenter:** "How do we do this? With a powerful, resilient, and scalable stack built entirely on **Bolt.new**."

*(Show the architecture diagram from the README)*

*   **Intelligent AI Router:** "Our AI isn't just one model. It's a fleet. Our custom-built AI router on **Supabase Edge Functions** intelligently routes queries to OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini. If one fails, our circuit breaker instantly reroutes. It's resilient."
    *(Briefly show a code snippet of `ai-router.ts`)*.
*   **Long-Term Memory:** "The AI knows Alex's business because of our semantic knowledge base, built on **Supabase Postgres** with the `pg_vector` extension. Every query gets smarter."
    *(Show a code snippet of the `match_knowledge` RPC function)*.
*   **Performance & Scalability:** "And it's fast. We use Supabase RPC functions for optimized queries and rely on their world-class infrastructure to scale."

**Presenter:** "Simply put, **Bolt.new** allowed us to build this complex, enterprise-ready application in days, not months. It was our accelerator."
