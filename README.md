- **Frontend:** React with Vite for a lightning-fast development experience.
- **Backend:** Supabase handles authentication, database (Postgres), file storage, and serverless Edge Functions.
- **Database:** Leverages advanced Postgres features like RLS for security and `pg_vector` for semantic search.
- **AI Integration:** A custom AI router with a circuit breaker intelligently queries multiple top-tier AI models for optimal results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm / yarn / pnpm
- Supabase Account
- API keys for OpenAI, Gemini, and/or Anthropic

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/genesis-heritage-pro.git
    cd genesis-heritage-pro
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Supabase:**
    - Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com).
    - In the SQL Editor, run the schema from `supabase/market_ready_schema.sql`.
    - (Optional) Run the seed script from `supabase/seed.sql`.
    - Run the RPC functions script from `supabase/rpc_functions.sql`.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    - Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if available) or add the following:
      ```env
      VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
      VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
      
      VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
      VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key
      VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
      ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The app should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Deploying Supabase Functions

- Install the Supabase CLI: `npm install -g supabase`
- Log in: `supabase login`
- Link your project: `supabase link --project-ref <your-project-id>`
- Deploy a function: `supabase functions deploy <function-name>`

## üèÜ Hackathon Focus: "Why Bolt.new?"

We leveraged the **Bolt.new** platform to its fullest:
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Supabase's all-in-one backend allowed us to build secure, complex features in record time.
- **Scalable AI:** Easy integration with serverless Edge Functions enabled us to build a sophisticated, multi-provider AI router without managing our own infrastructure.
- **Advanced Database Features:** Direct access to Postgres and extensions like `pg_vector` was critical for implementing our innovative semantic search and knowledge base features.

Bolt.new was not just a platform; it was an accelerator that enabled us to focus on our unique vision of fusing culture and business.
